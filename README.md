This repository contains folders pertaining to my Machine Learning Engineering class project.

This project aims to explore the application of four different regression models to predict the maximum ratio of lift to drag coefficients of a range of airfoils given specific geometric parameters.
Key evaluation metrics I for in this project are R-2 scores and the mean squared error (MSE) to study how effectively the models perform and optimize them. I visualize the output using scatterplots of predicted targets versus actual targets. 
Finally, I will interpret the weights that the linear regression models assign to the features to understand the impact of each predictor variable (airfoil geometry parameter) on the target.
