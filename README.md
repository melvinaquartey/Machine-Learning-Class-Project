# Predicting Lift Coefficients from Airfoil Geometric Parameters Through Machine Learning
This repository contains folders pertaining to my Machine Learning Engineering class project.

This project aims to explore the application of linear regression, a simpler and interpretable machine learning technique, to predict lift coefficients of a range of airfoils given specific geometric parameters.
Key evaluation metrics I will be looking out for in this project are accuracy scores and the mean squared error (MSE) to study how effective the model performs and possibly optimize it on different hyperparameters. Then, I will visualize the output using scatterplots of predicted lift coefficients versus actual lift coefficients with expectations of a strong linear relationship. 
Finally, I will interpret the weights of the linear regression model to understand the impact of each predictor variable (airfoil geometry parameters) on the lift coefficient.
